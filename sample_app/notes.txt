Chapter 6 

bundle exec rake db:rollback to rollback (obviously)

rails c --sandbox

Model.create runs Model.new and then Model.save and returns the new instance, whereas Model.new returns true or false

Reload reloads a value from a databse. You can set a value temporarily but reload it again from the database to reset it back to the original. 

Can update attributes by setting and saving, or by update_attributes or update_attribute

bundle exec rake test:prepare
	- ensures that the dev db is reflected in test

respond_to checks that an object will respond to a given method

You can write validates with or without parentheses

By adding a validation, you can then do
	User.new  
	User.save 
	User.valid?

	To new the user, save it and see if it saves, and finally check if it is valid

	If invalid,
		User.errors

	to log errors
	

Because a user can make multiple requests for the same email registration, you need to ACTUALLY prevent duplication / enforce uniqueness by checking uniqueness of a database index. 


specify is a synonym for it

- let provides a convenient way to define local variables inside of functions. It also memoizes the object, so you dont have to make multiple calls 


Questions
	-What does reload do?
	-What does respond_to do?
	-What does subject do (in rspec?)
